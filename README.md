# Potfolio


In this portfolio, you will find the test cases I have written for selected pages of the website.

I actively participated in the testing of a website, where I was responsible for creating comprehensive test cases. I efficiently managed test cycles using Zephyr, and diligently worked with checklists to ensure thorough coverage. My role also involved meticulous website testing, writing detailed bug reports, performing regression tests, and testing both the UX and UI to identify and report any issues.
